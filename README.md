## Notes

Figuring out the components that were already created for me and what they hold or do was a little tricky at first, but I was able to get through the small bump as I continued working through the challenges. Being able to learn new methods is always useful for projects and keeping them on hand for future projects. Reduce was a new method that I got to learn and apply through this prework, and it took a little time to memorize how to structure it. But the repetitive usage allowed me to get it down by the end of the project!
